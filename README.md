Welcome to the development of an interactive quiz 
application  using HTML.

You will learn how to leverage HTML, CSS, and
   JavaScript to create a functional and engaging quiz
   experience.

An interactive quiz app is a dynamic platform designed to engage users with fun and challenging quizzes on various topics. 
It offers features like timed challenges, leaderboards, and personalized results, making learning both entertaining and competitive. 

Interactive quiz applications are reshaping the way we approach learning, making it accessible, engaging, and effective for users  
of all age groups. These platforms combine technology with educational methods to foster both enjoyment and knowledge acquisition 
in a highly interactive environment.

Features of Interactive Learning Through Quiz Apps:

1.Multiple Choice Questions: The foundation of quiz apps lies in their diverse question formats, with multiple-choice questions being 
the most common. These questions can cover a wide array of topics. These structured options make the experience simple yet impactful.

2.Instant Feedback: Providing immediate feedback on answers is one of the app’s strongest educational tools. Users are not only informed 
whether their answer is correct or incorrect but are also given explanations, reinforcing learning by offering context or additional
information. This feature ensures that learning happens in real time, keeping users informed and engaged.

3.Score Tracking and Progress Monitoring: To maintain interest and motivation, the app calculates and displays users' scores after each quiz.
Advanced versions may also allow tracking over time, showing improvement trends or knowledge gaps. Detailed performance analytics can help
users understand areas where they excel and topics requiring more attention.
